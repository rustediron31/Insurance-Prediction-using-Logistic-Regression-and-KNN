# Insurance-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression-and-KNN
This project utilizes Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict the likelihood of an insurance claim based on various customer and policyholder features. By analyzing historical insurance data, the model identifies patterns to assess risk and forecast claim occurrences.

## Features:
**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for modeling.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method used to model the probability of a binary outcome.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric classification algorithm used to classify data based on feature similarity.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, precision
